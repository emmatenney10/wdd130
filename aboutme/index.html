    <h2>Emma Tenney</h2>
    <p> Right now I'm trying to get my associates through Pathway and then
        go back to UVU to pursue a Bachelors in Animation and Game development.
        I'm Hoping that having a background knowledge in different computer 
        elements will help me be more prepared to apply for the program.</p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies are drawing, watching movies, and taking care of
        my ever growing collection of plants. Honestly, I really like to do anything
        that has to do with making or creating something. So hopefully coding
        can just be a new avenue for me to do that!</p>
    </p>I am working part-time and going back to being a student full time, after
    taking a break from school for a year.</p>
